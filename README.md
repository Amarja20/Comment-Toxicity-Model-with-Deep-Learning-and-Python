# Comment-Toxicity-Model-with-Deep-Learning-and-Python

# Motivation
In an digital era, addressing online toxicity is paramount for mainitaing a healthy and inclusive virtual environment. This project aims to develop a robust Comment Toxicity Model using Deep Learning and Python, leveraing a diverse dataset of Wikipedia comments.

# Overview of the Input Dataset
The input dataset consists of a large number of Wikipedia comments that have been categorised by human raters for toxic behavior. Below mentioned are the types of toxicity:

toxic
severe_toxic
obscene
threat
