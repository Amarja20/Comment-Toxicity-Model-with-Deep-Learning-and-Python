# Comment-Toxicity-Model-with-Deep-Learning-and-Python

# Motivation

A Detailed analysis of Chest X-rays can assist in the early detection of various medical conditions, including respiratory diseases, cardiac issues, and most importantly, pulmonary abnormalities such as pneumonia. Early detection allows for prompt medical intervention, leading to better treatment outcomes and increased chances of recovery. In such a scenario, Image Classifier for Chest X-rays plays an important role in leveraging data analytics to optimize health care and improve the accuracy of medical dignostics.

# Overview of the Input Dataset
The input dataset consists of a large number of Wikipedia comments that have been categorised by human raters for toxic behavior. Below mentioned are the types of toxicity:

toxic
severe_toxic
obscene
threat
insult
identity_hate


# Output
The output is a detailed Deep learning model that classifies images into two sub-clases.
